1. Introduction

In the course "Advanced Learning Algorithms" on Coursera, a project was undertaken to develop a Decision Tree algorithm to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous. This project aimed to apply machine learning techniques to solve a practical classification problem and enhance model accuracy.

2. Objective

The primary objective of this project was to build a Decision Tree model in Python that can accurately classify mushrooms based on their characteristics. The goal was to utilize advanced machine learning techniques to determine whether a mushroom is safe for consumption or potentially harmful.

3. Methodology

3.1. Decision Tree Algorithm

The Decision Tree algorithm was chosen for its interpretability and effectiveness in handling categorical data. The process involved the following key steps:

Entropy Calculation: Entropy was used to measure the impurity or uncertainty in the dataset. It helped in determining how well the features split the data.
Data Splitting: The dataset was divided based on the calculated entropy to create decision nodes in the tree.
Information Gain Analysis: Information gain was assessed to identify the best features for splitting the data, which was crucial for optimizing the decision-making process and tree construction.
3.2. Implementation

The implementation was carried out using Python, leveraging libraries and tools for efficient data handling and algorithm execution. The steps included:

Data Preparation: Data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it was suitable for training the model.
Model Training: The Decision Tree algorithm was trained on the dataset to learn the patterns associated with edible and poisonous mushrooms.
Feature Selection: Features were selected based on their ability to provide the most significant information gain, thereby improving the model's accuracy.
4. Results

The Decision Tree model was evaluated for its classification performance. Key results include:

Improved Accuracy: By selecting the optimal feature splits, the model's classification performance was enhanced, achieving a high level of accuracy in distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms.
Practical Use Cases: The enhanced model provides a reliable tool for practical applications, such as assisting in the safe identification of mushrooms in real-world scenarios.
5. Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated the application of the Decision Tree algorithm to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous. By implementing entropy calculation, data splitting, and information gain analysis, the model's accuracy was significantly improved. This work highlights the effectiveness of advanced machine learning techniques in solving classification problems and their potential impact on practical use cases.

6. Future Work

Future improvements could involve exploring other machine learning algorithms for comparison, incorporating additional features for better classification, and testing the model with larger and more diverse datasets to enhance its generalizability.
